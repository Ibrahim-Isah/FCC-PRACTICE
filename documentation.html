                    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
                        It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
                         (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the 
                         objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                          them.</p>

                        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                         Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as 
                         operators, control structures, and statements. 
                         Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by 
                         supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                         <ul>
                             <li>
                                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                                 objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                                  For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place 
                                  elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse 
                                  clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                             </li>
                             <li>
                                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying 
                                objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, 
                                server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a 
                                database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to 
                                another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

                <article>
                    <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. 
                        The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. 
                        JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow 
                        constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                        <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, 
                            JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types 
                            representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based 
                            object model instead of the more common class-based object model. 
                            The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can 
                            vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative 
                            requirements.
                             Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
                         first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
                         <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                            greetMe("World");</code>

                <article>
                    <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. 
                        The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                        <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent 
                            characters can also be digits (0-9). 
                            Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase)
                             and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>

                <article>
                    <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. 
                        The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier:
                         it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, 
                         numeric, or underscore characters.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Six data types that are primitives
                            <ul>
                                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                                <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, 
                                    null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                                <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                                <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                                <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                                <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                            </ul>
